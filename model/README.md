# Requirement
Please refer to [Conditional 3D Shape Generation based on Shape-Image-Text Aligned Latent Representation](https://neuralcarver.github.io/michelangelo) for the detailed environment setup (i.e. `requirements.txt`). The implementation of Can3Tok is based on this work. We use ./configs/aligned_shape_latents/shapevae-256.yaml as our settings.
